What does this do?

 This app will allow you to change the master volume of the window you are using. 
 
 For example: If you are on Dirt 4 in fullscreen, instead of tabbing out and changing the volume mixer, just press Ctrl+Shift+Q/A to reduce or increase the volume. 

How to install:
 - Clone or download the repository.
 - Use run.bat (this will start the python virtual env and run the app).
 - Change window to a exe that provides sound.
 - Use Ctrl+Shift+Q to increase volume
 - Use Ctrl+Shift+A to decrease volume
